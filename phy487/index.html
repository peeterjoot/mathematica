This was an attempt to decode the notation used in Desai for the Legendre functions used for Hydrogenic atoms.  He defines the orbital functions in terms of Legendre functions, but does not precisely define his Legendre functions.

<p>
Debye temperature plot for a number of elements, and atomic radius plot.  Using hash like function mappings, and ElementData.  Also used colors in these plots to visually distinguish each of the s, p, d, f orbital regions.  For a less selective atomic radii plotting function, I used Cases and pattern matching to filter out the ElementData values that were missing or unavailable.  In a final version of the plotting function, overlapped atomic radii and Debye plots were made.  A static image of that plot is saved into the notes for discussion, but the live notebook version has cool ToolTip's on all the points showing the atomic symbols and the values in question.

<p>
Attempt at 2D Fourier fitting of capped radial. <p>The reason for some of these inverse radial Fourier fitting attempts was because I wanted to compute the Fourier coefficients for some sample periodic potentials for some numerical experimentation.  Naturally, the first one that I tried was an inverse radial potential, however, it turns out that this isn't re presentable by Fourier series since it is not square integrable.<p>It is possible to artificially alter the Coulomb potential so that some neighborhood of the origin is omitted, setting the potential to some constant value after that, but that doesn't seem like a physically reasonable model.  Asking Prof Julian about this he said:<p>"There are two effects, one is that the potential doesn't go to -infty at the origin, due to Pauli exclusion.  As you suggest, putting a flat bottom on the potential probably works okay.  But also, due to screening (in a metal at least) the potential isn't 1/r, but rather it cuts off more quickly.<p>A commonly used compromise is the "muffin tin potential, which has a flat bottom in a sphere around the atomic position, then a step up to another flat region between the atoms.  In solving this one puts a linear combination of spherical harmonics inside the muffin tin, and plane waves in the interstitial region, and match them at the boundary.<p>But putting  a flat bottom on a screened Coulomb potential is probably a reasonable first thing to try."<p>I appear to have hit convergence issues attempting the Fourier fittings for such a cap in a more interesting 2D lattice.

Look for BCC basis vectors.  First try was wrong, but found suitable vectors with small correction.  This verifies that the new ones work, and also finds the reciprocal basis.  Also used this notebook to experiment with the Report stylesheet, mixing text, inline math, and math cells in one doc.  End result looks much nicer than a plain styled notebook.

This notebook generalizes the notebook for problem set 6, problem 1, which had a Fermi energy/temperature calculation.  This splits out the generic physical constants, and splits out the ElementData and ChemicalData lookup.  The subsequent calculation and formatting of the data was split somewhat.  It would be worthwhile to experiment with reworking this to use Rule lists, like perl hashes, to tag the various fields with names, which would make the parameter passing more flexible.

Rework fermiInfoForElementOrig.nb passing parameters by hashes, ie. Rule Lists.  As expected, this was a much cleaner result, as the huge lists of Module local variables are not required passing along the previous phases of the computations.  In the end, the descriptive Rule List can be used directly as a ReplaceAll on the values List, with all the grunt work of the display done by a single Rule to List, and TableFormat operation.

N atom basis diamond lattice calculations.  Allows up to 5 mass locators in the grid and a vector parameterized parallelepiped lattice cell.  This uses TabView and Nasser's tricks to avoid evaluation where undesirable.  This also includes the distribution relation.  This is my most sophisticated sample of Mathematica programming so far.
