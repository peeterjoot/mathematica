My Mathematica notebooks.
</title>
<p>
Here is a listing of my mathematica notebooks. The most recent of any of these notebooks can all be obtained from my github <a href="https://github.com/peeterjoot/mathematica">Mathematica repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/">Wolfram CDF player</a> can also be used to view a number of these notebooks after download.

<ul>
   <li> Feb 19, 2012  <a href="../classicalmechanics/infiniteCylinderPotential.cdf">classicalmechanics/infiniteCylinderPotential.cdf</a>
<p>
Attempt at evaluating the potential for an infinite cylinder.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Feb 24, 2012  <a href="../classicalmechanics/psIIp4InfPlanePotTakeIII.cdf">classicalmechanics/psIIp4InfPlanePotTakeIII.cdf</a>
<p>
Attempt at evaluating the potential for an infinite plane.  Experimenting with using mathematica to produce decent documents, as well as trying a variation of the previous calculation where I used $R^2 \sim e$.<p>The final output is not as nice as latex, but the save as latex option seems promising.  New Mathematica tools used in this notebook include HoldForm, TraditionalForm, and ReleaseHold, which can be used to generate traditional form by default for scratch display generation.<p>Note that cut-and-pasting URLS in comments as I've been doing get mangled and can't be followed.  Switched the ones in this doc to Insert->Hyperlink instead.

   <li> Feb 27, 2012  <a href="../classicalmechanics/psIIp4InfCylPot.cdf">classicalmechanics/psIIp4InfCylPot.cdf</a>
<p>
Attempt evaluation of a cylindrical potential.<p>New Mathematica methods used: HoldForm, Assuming, Assumptions.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Jan 26, 2016  <a href="../classicalmechanics/multisphericalPendulum.nb">classicalmechanics/multisphericalPendulum.nb</a>
<p>
calculate the matrix products from the papers to verify (and as it turns out, correct).
