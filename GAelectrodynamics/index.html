<p>
This is the notebook for a few bivector related illustrations.  The first is two circular representations of a bivector viewed from a 3D vantage point.  Another is a bivector addition figure, with two bivectors summed in 3D.  That figure was confusing (but cool), and has been left out of the book.  The last figure separates the space between those bivectors summed in the second figure showing the summands and the sum all distinct.  The current draft of the book includes this figure, but it is still a bit confusing.
