Chronological listing of Mathematica notebooks

<ul>
   <li> Sep 28, 2015  <a href="../phy1520/anticommutingWithZeroEigenvalue.nb">phy1520/anticommutingWithZeroEigenvalue.nb</a>
<p>
Construct and verify an example of a pair of anticommuting matrices each having a zero eigenvalue, and a shared eigenvector.  This was for Sakurai p.1.17, and includes some numeric commutator expansions to verify the example constructions done with that problem.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Oct 18, 2015  <a href="../phy1520/ps3/ps3Fig2.nb">phy1520/ps3/ps3Fig2.nb</a>
<p>
Plot some probability densities for ps3 p2.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Oct 25, 2015  <a href="../phy1520/energyVsMomentumForDiracStepPotentialWaveFunctions.nb">phy1520/energyVsMomentumForDiracStepPotentialWaveFunctions.nb</a>
<p>
A Manipulate to explore the energy vs momentum curves for a stepped potential barrier and the Dirac Hamiltonian.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Nov 1, 2015  <a href="../phy1520/spinOneHalfSymbolicManipulation.nb">phy1520/spinOneHalfSymbolicManipulation.nb</a>
<p>
For a spin one-half system Sakurai leaves it to the reader (and also to problem 3.10) to verify that knowledge of the three ensemble averages \( \expectation{S_x}, \expectation{S_y}, \expectation{S_z} \) is sufficient to reconstruct the density operator.  Showing that is algebraically messy, and well suited to do in Mathematica.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Nov 2, 2015  <a href="../phy1520/eulerAngleVsNormalRotationPauliMatrices.nb">phy1520/eulerAngleVsNormalRotationPauliMatrices.nb</a>
<p>
Comparing a unimodular transformation to an arbitrary rotation matrix was trivial.  To do the same for an Euler angle rotation matrix and arbitrary matrix is less so because of sign differences.  Here is a dumb symbol expansion of the full rotation on a general vector in Pauli matrix form to have a look at the two results and see if there is anything striking.  It turns out there is not anything striking.  Both expressions are messy even after FullSimplify.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Nov 16, 2015  <a href="../phy1520/spinOneOperatorRepresentation.nb">phy1520/spinOneOperatorRepresentation.nb</a>
<p>
Spin one operators.  Sakurai only seems to list the \( S_y \) spin one matrix representation.  See these in Desai, but need to verify that all my corrections to Desai eq. (27.117) are correct.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Nov 19, 2015  <a href="../phy1520/diracDeltaFunctionIntegrals.nb">phy1520/diracDeltaFunctionIntegrals.nb</a>
<p>
Double check the integral done in the Dirac delta function problem, and perform the first Fourier transformation.

<p>

</p>

<p>
Generalize and improve code to compute Clebsch-Gorgon coefficients, and apply to spin two plus spin one.
</p>
</li>
   <li> Nov 24, 2015  <a href="../phy1520/spinOneDensityOperatorRepresentationInTermsOfEnsembleAverages.nb">phy1520/spinOneDensityOperatorRepresentationInTermsOfEnsembleAverages.nb</a>
<p>
Solution for Sakurai problem 3.12: What must we know in addition to the ensemble averages of the spin operators to completely characterize the density matrix of a spin 1 system?  I guessed that we also needed the ensemble averages of at least the squares, but that and the unit trace, was not enough, since those relations do not provide nine equations, for the nine unknowns.   Omitting the trace requirement, but also introducing variables for the other second order products was enough to solve the problem.  Printing out all those products is helpful to show why this is the case: you can see visually that these products appear to span the space of \( 3 \times 3 \) matrices.

<p>
An attempt to do ps7 pr. 3 with Mathematica.  It was hard to figure out how to make Mathematica cope with the delta functions, so I gave up and did it manually.

<p>
Verify all the hand calculations for ps7 p2, Hydrogen atom ground state.  I found a better way to do the Hydrogen vs Helium ground state comparison, and rewrote all the content that this notebook applied to.  This is, however, a nice standalone computation of the Hydrogen ground state energy.
</p>

Verify all the hand calculations for ps7 p2.  Started with the Helium atom ground state calculation, without electron-electron interaction.  This was followed up with a verification of the electron-electron interaction integrals and end results too.

<p>
Recompute the Hydrogen vs. Helium ground state energy entirely in Mathematica to see if I am still getting the factor of 8 difference that I computed by hand.  That factor of 8 turns out to be correct.

Spin three halves operator question (Sakurai 3.33).  Implement operators for \( S_{+}, S_{-}, S_z \) that act on kets \( \ket{\pm 3/2}, \ket{\pm 1/2}\).  These operators act on only a single basis element, but are used to construct the matrix representations for these operators (which are more general).  Use those matrices to compute the representation of the Hamiltonian for the problem and compute its energy eigenvalues.  Display the end result and the representations for all of \( S_{+}, S_{-}, S_x, S_y, S_z, H = A ( 3 S_z^2 - \BS^2) + B( S_{+}^2 + S_{-}^2) \).
