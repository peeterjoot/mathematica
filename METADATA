This notebook was left using Collect instead of coefficient, so the collected factors do not match the text equation results without additional manual comparison work.

Animate the stress tensor associated with the problem, for different points and values of Poisson's ratio.

This generalizes the solution of the problem since answers visually whether the point is under expansion (blue arrow) or under compression (red arrow) at each point in space.

Mathematica manipulate sliders are used to select the spatial points and the value of Poisson's ratio.

Used a number of new (for me) mathematica features: Table, Arrow, If, Part, multiple colors in Graphics3D, DiagonalMatrix, Diagonal (select diagonal into list), Tr (not Trace!), Map, Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and in a later version Eigensystem to replace the last two.

The code has links to various stackexchange questions for this notebook.  There's an answer on scaling that's incorporated into the Graphics3D options.  One more mathematica stackexchange question answered on this little notebook which motivated the Dynamic and DynamicModule calls now here, and one more that drove the change to use Eigensystem.

The reason for some of these inverse radial Fourier fitting attempts was because I wanted to compute the Fourier coefficients for some sample periodic potentials for some numerical experimentation.  Naturally, the first one that I tried was an inverse radial potential, however, it turns out that this isn't re presentable by Fourier series since it is not square integrable.

It is possible to artificially alter the Coulomb potential so that some neighborhood of the origin is omitted, setting the potential to some constant value after that, but that doesn't seem like a physically reasonable model.  Asking Prof Julian about this he said:

"There are two effects, one is that the potential doesn't go to -\infty at the origin, due to Pauli exclusion.  As you suggest, putting a flat bottom on the potential probably works okay.  But also, due to screening (in a metal at least) the potential isn't 1/r, but rather it cuts off more quickly.

A commonly used compromise is the "muffin tin potential, which has a flat bottom in a sphere around the atomic position, then a step up to another flat region between the atoms.  In solving this one puts a linear combination of spherical harmonics inside the muffin tin, and plane waves in the interstitial region, and match them at the boundary.

But putting  a flat bottom on a screened Coulomb potential is probably a reasonable first thing to try."

I appear to have hit convergence issues attempting the Fourier fittings for such a cap in a more interesting 2D lattice.
